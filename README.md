# macos-configure

## Status
*WARNING:* this repository is in an experimental state. You should know
what you are doing before you use it.

## Goal
This is a small bit of scripting to setup my development macOS machine.
Eventually I hope to incorporate the ideas from
https://github.com/facebook/IT-CPE to more fully automate the setup
of a machine. The goal is to be able to open a new computer, run one
command and then be able to be fully productive.

## Running
To configure your machine run `./install.sh`


## Known Limitations
The macOS AppStore applications already need to be authorized for the
user's AppleID. I'm sure there is a way to use Apple's Volume Purchase
Program combined with the Device Enrollment Program, but that seems
to require a real business, or at least a DUNS number, and that is
more than I was willing to hack on in a weekend.
