# macos-configure

## Status
*WARNING:* this repository is in an experimental state. You should know
what you are doing before you use it.

## Goal
This is a small bit of scripting to setup my development macOS machine.
Eventually I hope to incorporate the ideas from
[https://github.com/facebook/IT-CPE] to more fully automate the setup
of a machine. The goal is to be able to open a new computer, run one
command and then be able to be fully productive.

## Running
To configure your machine run `./install.sh`
